aging reasons and solutions
##DNA damage theory of aging

###DNA damage and Mutation
####damage####
most of the time repairable<br>
can lead to cell death
single and double strand breaks
8-OHdG (chemically changed base)
####mutation
not repairable
rarely leads to cancer (if survival advantage)
####Repair mechanisms

###Organs
What happens to organs with age?
####Brain
neurons last the entire life
acuumulation of DNA damage which leads to cell death 
####Muscle
oxidative damage in mitochondria results in less proteins of certain types that are necessary for controlling force in the muscles
####Stem cells
loss due to damage and result of regulated disintegration (apoptosis)
hair loss is due to death of stem cells
###Mesopause
###What can we do?
####caloric restriction
####Rapamycin and other NAD boosters
<h4>damage prevention
use sunscreen
###Epigentics
clock
methylation
